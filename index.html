      <p style="font-size:25px;color:white;text-align:center;">Back in June 2019, my bot got hacked and started posting furry porn to every server that Special Agent Phillips was in and sent the two pictures and an invite link to every text channel the servers had. I have a screenshot of what the message said, <a href="images/message.png">click here</a>. This really pissed me off for a while because I spent so long on that bot, messing around, adding stupid features to it and just randomly, out of the blue... It gets hacked and starts posting that shit to everyone that had the bot on their server. I had to remove the bot completely because otherwise they would have probably done worse. A couple of months later, I decided re-create the bot again so I could add it to my local server and at one point I was deciding whether I wanted to make it public again but, because of what happened then and I've spent so long deciding whether or not I'm willing to put the bot back out there and re-do all of this. I've decided it's done, it's over. I can't be bothered to continue the bot anymore. I only created the bot because I was bored and wanted to do something but now all of that shit happened I just can't really be bothered to go through all of that again, even though it may not happen again I just can't be arsed. It's over.</p>

      <p style="font-size:25px;color:white;text-align:center;">Thanks to everyone that added my bot to their servers.</p>
      <p style="font-size:25px;color:white;text-align:center;">Goodbye. - Alex</p>
